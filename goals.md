## AginahBot's immediate goals (subject to change):
1. Host a multiworld given a `.multidata` file
2. Support sending commands to a multiworld server.
3. Only authorized users may send commands to a multiworld server
4. Authorized users may send only commands explicitly whitelisted on a per-user basis
5. Create two voice and text race channels on demand, and grant roles on text-channel-one to users of
    voice-channel-one. Grant roles on text-channel-two to users of voice-channel-two.
6. Delete race voice and text channels when all users leave both voice channels

## AginahBot's future plans (subject to change):
1. Generate a multiworld given a zip file containing `.yaml` files, and automatically host
2. Support users uploading a `.zip` file containing server files (`host.yaml`, `meta.yaml`, etc)
