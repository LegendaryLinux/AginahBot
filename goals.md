## AginahBot's goals (subject to change):
1. Host a multiworld given a `.multidata` file
2. Generate a multiworld given a zip file containing `.yaml` files, and automatically host
3. Support sending commands to a multiworld server.
4. Only authorized users may send commands to a multiworld server
5. Authorized users may send only commands explicitly whitelisted on a per-user basis
6. Create two voice and text race channels on demand, and grant roles on text-channel-one to users of
    voice-channel-one. Grant roles on text-channel-two to users of voice-channel-two.
7. Delete race voice and text channels when all users leave both voice channels
