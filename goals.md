## AginahBot's immediate goals (subject to change): 
1. Only authorized users may send commands to a multiworld server
2. Authorized users may send only commands explicitly whitelisted on a per-user basis

## Completed:
- Create two voice and text race channels on demand, and grant roles on text-channel-one to users of
    voice-channel-one. Grant roles on text-channel-two to users of voice-channel-two. Delete race voice
    and text channels when all users leave both voice channels
- Support casual multiworld voice and text channels, and automatic assignment of permissions on those channels
- Host a multiworld given a `.multidata` file
- Support sending commands to a multiworld server.
